=head1 gpgpwd data format specification

This file specifies the gpgpwd data format, revision 2, as implemented by
gpgpwd.

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

=head1 OVERVIEW

=over

=item Inner content: a JSON datastructure.

=item Outer content: gpg signature around the JSON datastructure

=item Outer container: the gpg-signed JSON dump with binary gpg encryption

=back

=head1 JSON DATA STRUCTURE

=head2 On-disk format

The JSON datastructure must contain the below set of keys, and a "pwds"
structure.  The JSON dump should have a newline added at each comma to avoid
too long lines (which gpg doesn't like for text signatures).

When loading the data, all newlines must be stripped before attempting to parse
the JSON. If the JSON fails to parse then the program should error out and
provide the user with information about how to recover their data.

=over

=item lastVersion

Must contain the version number of the application (usually gpgpwd) that wrote
the file. If another program implements this data format, that programs version
number should be inserted instead.

=item gpgpwdDataVersion

Contains the version number of the gpgpwd data format. Must be "2" for the
format specified in this file. If this field is a value other than "2" then the
program should error out. If it is a value lower than "2" it may perform an
upgrade to version 2. If it is higher than "2" the program should error out
with a message referencing where to find a newer version of the program that
may support this format version.

=item generator

Contains an arbitrary "generator" string with whatever program wrote the file.
gpgpwd writes the application name, version and URL in this field.

=item pwds

This is a key->value structure. The key must be the user-provided name of what
the password is for, the value must be the base64-encoded gpg-encrypted
password. The base64 data should be without any newlines.

=back

=head2 Signature

The JSON dump must be signed by gpg using the same key that will later be used
to encrypt the data. Before a JSON parser can parse the JSON dump you must
strip away all of the gpg metadata (including the two BEGIN lines, the
signature and signature fields, the hash-field and the END line).

When loading a file this signature must be verified and compared to belong to
the key that was used for the outer encryption. If it does not match then the
program should error out, but it may optionally provide the user a means to
bypass the check to retrieve whatever data is contained, but in this case it
must inform the user clearly that the data may have been compromised.

=head2 Encrypted dump

The gpg-signed JSON dump must be stored as a binary encrypted file through gpg.
GPG-compression should be disabled.

=head1 Error handling

Most of the error handling has already been specified. In the case of "garbage"
or unknown data within the file, the application should immediately error out.
In these cases the application should provide information about the error,
advice on recovering data and suggestions about where a newer version of the
program may be downloaded (which may be able to read the file).

=head1 Backwards compatibility

Revision 1 of this data format was never specified, thus no backwards
compatibility is required. The implementer may optionally implement an
upgrade path from revision 1 as specified in this section.

Revision 1 files do not contain a signature, and the field gpgpwdDataVersion
must be "1". The program may thus chose to interperate a file missing a
signature as it containing a revision 1 data structure and then load that as
JSON. Once that is done it must verify that gpgpwdDataVersion is "1".

If both of these tests verify then the application may perform the upgrade.
The upgrade involves iterating through all entries in the "pwds" structure,
encrypting each of the values and storing them according to this specification.
Once this has been done, the gpgpwdDataVersion field must be increased to "2".
At this point the data structure loaded matches revision 2 as specified in this
file and the program may write it as a revision 2 file (signed and encrypted,
as previously specified).

=head1 EXAMPLE

This is an example of the JSON-dump with a GPG signature, as it would look when
decrypted manually by the user, or in gpgpwd before adding the final outer
layer of encryption.
