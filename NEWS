Version 0.6
- Now has a config directory in XDG_CONFIG_HOME/gpgpwd
- Moved password file to gpgpwd.db in the config directory
    (symlink in place to the old file when upgrading for compatibility)
- Added support for managing git within gpgpwd
- Added a configuration file
- Added a config command to manage the configuration file
- Added a --set parameter for temporarily overriding config options
- gpgpwd can now detect that a user has no gpg-keys
- The parameters --git and --xcilp-clipboard have been deprecated.
    --set can now be used to achieve the same effect.
- The parameter --no-git has been removed, and now produces an error
    (because the new --set command is not identical to --no-git)
- Improved handling of errors returned from gpg
- Fixed problems with using gpgpwd when running without an X-server and
    at the same time without a gpg-agent
- Added support for changing the default password length

Version 0.5
- Now requires the user to manually run "gpgpwd upgrade" to upgrade a v1
    database to the v2 database used by gpgpwd 0.4 and later.
- Now silences warnings from gpg2 when running under gnome (unless in verbose
    mode, this avoids warnings about GNOME keyring manager)
- Now outputs the best matching password first rather than last
- Removed --force-unsafe
- Various code cleanup

Version 0.4
  NOTE: The data format changes in 0.4 makes the password database unreadable
        with gpgpwd 0.3 and earlier.
- Added a cryptographic signature to the password database to allow
    gpgpwd to detect tampering.
- Added a second layer of encryption where each password is encrypted
    individually in addition to the existing encryption of the
    database as a whole. This protects against attacks on the
    in-memory decrypted password database.
- Replaced the slower --git mode with the one used by --fast-git
- Made the equivalent of the old --try-require-agent parameter the default.
    Removed --require-agent, --no-require-agent and --disable-agent.
- Added automatic starting of a gpg-agent when needed (if gpgpwd starts
    a gpg-agent, that agent will be shut down before gpgpwd exits)
- Use Term::ReadLine to read input (enables use of arrow keys)
- Added commands to the password prompt to allow the user to generate
    an alphanumeric-only password when needed
- Can now handle ~/.gpgpwddb being a symlink when git-mode is enabled

Version 0.3
- Added --try-require-agent, acts like --require-agent if an agent
    is available, and like --no-require-agent if it isn't
- Added --fast-git, provides faster access to passwords in git
    by pulling after getting a password (and then re-getting
    it if the file changed)
- Added a 'rename' command
- Added short versions of several parameters
- Improved fuzzy searching
- Removed use of given/when as it is marked as experimental again in perl 5.18
- Replaced the old result sorting with a new score-based sorting system
    which should provide more accurate results
- Added an --all parameter for retrieval of all possible matches
- Made the output when an invalid command is invoked more friendly
- Removed some gpg warnings when gpg is symlinked to gpg2
- Explicitly disable gpg compression

Version 0.2
- Clarified that 'get' takes a regular expression as its argument
- Added --disable-agent, used to disable use of gpg-agent
- Added --verbose and some verbose messages
- Will now use gpg2 if gpg isn't installed
- Will now perform a fuzzy search when nothing matching the exact
    regex is found
- Fixed disabling of xclip

Version 0.1
- Initial release
