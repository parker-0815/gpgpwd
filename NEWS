Version 0.4
- Added a cryptographic signature to the password database to allow
    gpgpwd to detect tampering.
- Added a second layer of encryption where each password is encrypted
    individually in addition to the existing encryption of the
    database as a whole. This protects against attacks on the
    in-memory decrypted password database.
- Replaced the slower --git mode with the one used by --fast-git

Version 0.3
- Added --try-require-agent, acts like --require-agent if an agent
    is available, and like --no-require-agent if it isn't
- Added --fast-git, provides faster access to passwords in git
    by pulling after getting a password (and then re-getting
    it if the file changed)
- Added a 'rename' command
- Added short versions of several parameters
- Improved fuzzy searching
- Removed use of given/when as it is marked as experimental again in perl 5.18
- Replaced the old result sorting with a new score-based sorting system
    which should provide more accurate results
- Added an --all parameter for retrieval of all possible matches
- Made the output when an invalid command is invoked more friendly
- Removed some gpg warnings when gpg is symlinked to gpg2
- Explicitly disable gpg compression

Version 0.2
- Clarified that 'get' takes a regular expression as its argument
- Added --disable-agent, used to disable use of gpg-agent
- Added --verbose and some verbose messages
- Will now use gpg2 if gpg isn't installed
- Will now perform a fuzzy search when nothing matching the exact
    regex is found
- Fixed disabling of xclip

Version 0.1
- Initial release
